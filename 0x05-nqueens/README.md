# N Queens
This project not only tests programming and problem-solving skills but also offers an excellent opportunity to learn about algorithmic thinking and optimization techniques. This is part of the **Software Engineering** program at **ALX**.

## Concepts Needed
* Backtracking Algorithms: Understanding how backtracking algorithms work to explore all potential solutions to a problem and backtrack when a solution cannot be completed.
* Recursion: Using recursive functions to implement backtracking algorithms.
* List Manipulations in Python: Creating and manipulating lists, especially to store the positions of queens on the board.
* Python Command Line Arguments: Handling command-line arguments with the `sys` module.

## Requirements
* All files are interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.4.3)
* All files end with a new line
* The first line of all files is exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
* There is a `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project
* All code used the `PEP 8` style (version 1.7.*)
* All files are executable

## Required Files
* `utils.py` (https://intranet-projects-files.s3.amazonaws.com/webstack/utils.py)
* `client.py` (https://intranet-projects-files.s3.amazonaws.com/webstack/client.py)
* `fixtures.py` (https://intranet-projects-files.s3.amazonaws.com/webstack/fixtures.py)
